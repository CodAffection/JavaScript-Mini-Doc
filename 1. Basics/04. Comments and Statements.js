/*
? What is a Statement
Statement in any programming language refers to a complete set of instructions to perform a particular action.

eg.
 print a message to console
 > console.log('some message')
 show a popup dialog
 > alert('content goes here')

* Semi-colon is optional after each js statement, if you insist on writing multiple
* statements on a single line then semi-colon is a must to separate them each other.

. Comments

 - single line comment
 - multi-line comment
*/
