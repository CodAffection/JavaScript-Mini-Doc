? What is JavaScript? 
-JavaScript is a light-weight, interpreted or just-in-time compiled 
 programming language with first class functions.

Not going to make things harder for you by explaing

* Brendan Eich invented JS in 1995

? Pre Requisite for Learning JS
 - basic knowledge in HTML & CSS.

Previously JavaScript was primarily used to add functionality 
and behaviors to your website client-side. Nowadays it is being almost anywhere.
