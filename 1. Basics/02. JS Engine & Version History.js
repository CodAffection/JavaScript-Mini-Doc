? Do we need to install run-time environment for js
NO, it already comes with web browsers, commonly called as JavaScript Engine.

The main function of JavaScript Engine is that 
it convert our js code to machine readable code (also called as interpretation/ compilation).

JavaScript Engine is also a software created by web browser's manufacture.
Each Web Browser has named their JS Engine as follows.

Google Chrome -> v8
Mozilla Firefox -> Spider Monkey
MS Edge -> Chakra

Since Web Browsers comes with their own js engine. 
It is necessary to standardize these js engines.
Then only we'll have same output from these browsers for a given js file.

* JS Engine is Standardized by ECMA International.
They create standards for technologies in IT industry.
JS Standardization is called as ECMAScript or ECMA 262.

ECMAScript is often abbreviated as ES.

ECMAScript contains guidlines for creating JS Engine.
Like language syntax and semantics.

Other than JavaScript, JScript, ActionScript etc follows ECMAScript Guidlines.
But JavaScript is the most popular implementation of ECMAScript.
